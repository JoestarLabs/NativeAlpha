## FAQ

<details> 
<summary><b>Why use Native Alpha over a mobile browser?</b></summary>
<br>
Standard mobile browsers typically only offer fullscreen shortcuts if a website explicitly supplies a Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest. Native Alpha gives <i>every</i> website a native, borderless container while allowing independent permissions, cache controls, and adblock configurations per site.
</details>

<details> 
<summary><b>Does Native Alpha use its own browser engine?</b></summary>
<br>
No. Native Alpha runs on top of the built-in Android System WebView (Chromium). Keep your device's System WebView updated to benefit from the latest web standards, performance, and security fixes.
</details>

<details> 
<summary><b>Can I maintain separate logins for the same site?</b></summary>
<br>
Yes. Native Alpha supports sandboxed containers that isolate cookies, storage, and sessions across different instances of the same service.
</details>

<details> 
<summary><b>How are website icons retrieved?</b></summary>
<br>
Native Alpha probes the site's manifest, apple-touch-icon, and favicon tags (including SVG favicons) to find the highest available resolution. Custom icons can also be applied.
</details>

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Android SDK (API Level 37)
- Android NDK (r28+) & CMake (3.22.1+)
- JDK 21+
- Gradle 9.8+ (included wrapper)

### Build Debug APK
```bash
./gradlew assembleStandardDebug
```

### Build Release APK
```bash
./gradlew assembleStandardRelease
```

### 16 KB Page Size Compatibility
Native Alpha compiles its native C++ adblock engine (`:adblock-client`, sourced from [Edsuns/AdblockAndroid](https://github.com/Edsuns/AdblockAndroid)) directly from source using CMake and modern NDK r28c with flexible page size flags (`-DANDROID_SUPPORT_FLEXIBLE_PAGE_SIZES=ON` and `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384`). All 64-bit ELF binaries (`arm64-v8a` and `x86_64`) have their `LOAD` segments aligned at 16 KB boundaries, satisfying Google Play and Android 15+ requirements.
